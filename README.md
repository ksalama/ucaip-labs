# MLOps on Vertex AI

This example implements the end-to-end [MLOps process](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/practitioners_guide_to_mlops_whitepaper.pdf) using [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) platform and [Smart Analytics](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/smart-analytics) technology capabilities. The example use [Keras](https://keras.io/) to implement the ML model, [TFX](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx) to implement the training pipeline, and [Model Builder SDK](https://github.com/googleapis/python-aiplatform/tree/569d4cd03e888fde0171f7b0060695a14f99b072/google/cloud/aiplatform) to interact with Vertex AI.

## Getting started

1. [Setting up MLOps environment](provision) on Google Cloud.
2. Start your AI Notebook instance.
3. Open the JupyterLab then open a new Terminal
4. Clone the repository to your AI Notebook instance:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ksalama/ucaip-labs.git
    cd ucaip-labs
    ```
5. Install the required Python packages:
    ```
    pip install tfx==0.30.0 --user
    pip install -r requirements.txt --user
    ```
6. Upgrade the `gcloud` components:
    ```
   sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk
   gcloud components update
   ```

## Dataset Management

The [Chicago Taxi Trips](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/city-of-chicago-public-data/chicago-taxi-trips) dataset is one of [public datasets hosted with BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/), which includes taxi trips from 2013 to the present, reported to the City of Chicago in its role as a regulatory agency. The task is to predict whether a given trip will result in a tip > 20%.

The [01-dataset-management](01-dataset-management.ipynb) notebook covers:

1. Performing exploratory data analysis on the data in `BigQuery`.
2. Creating `Vertex AI` Dataset resource using the Python SDK.
3. Generating the schema for the raw data using [TensorFlow Data Validation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/tfdv).


## ML Development

We experiment with creating a [Custom Model](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-unified/docs/training/create-model-custom-training) using [02-experimentation](02-experimentation.ipynb) notebook, which covers:

1. Preparing the data using `Dataflow`.
2. Implementing a `Keras` classification model.
3. Training the `Keras` model with `Vertex AI` using a [pre-built container](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-unified/docs/training/pre-built-containers).
4. Upload the exported model from `Cloud Storage` to `Vertex AI`.
5. Exract and visualize experiment parameters from [Vertex AI Metadata](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/ml-metadata/introduction).

We use [Vertex TensorBoard](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/experiments/tensorboard-overview) 
and [Vertex ML Metadata](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/ml-metadata/introduction) to  track, visualize, and compare ML experiments.

In addition, the training steps are formalized by implementing a [TFX pipeline](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx).
The [03-training-formalization](02-tfx-interactive.ipynb) notebook covers implementing and testing the pipeline components interactively.

## Training Operationalization

The [04-pipeline-deployment](04-pipeline-deployment.ipynb) notebook covers executing the CI/CD steps for the training pipeline deployment using [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/overview). The CI/CD routine is defined in the [pipeline-deployment.yaml](pipeline-deployment.yaml) file, and consists of the following steps:

1. Clone the repository to the build environment.
2. Run unit tests.
3. Run a local e2e test of the `TFX` pipeline.
4. Build the ML container image for pipeline steps.
5. Compile the pipeline.
6. Upload the pipeline to `Cloud Storage`.

## Continuous Training

After testing, compiling, and uploading the pipeline definition to `Cloud Storage`, the pipeline is executed with respect to a trigger. 
We use [Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions) and [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub) as a triggering mechanism.
The `Cloud Function` listens to the `Pub/Sub` topic, and runs the training pipeline given a message sent to the `Pub/Sub` topic.
The `Cloud Function` is implemented in [src/pipeline_triggering](src/pipeline_triggering). 

The [05-continuous-training](05-continuous-training.ipynb) notebook covers:

1. Creating a Cloud `Pub/Sub` topic.
2. Deploying a `Cloud Function`.
3. Triggering the pipeline.

The end-to-end TFX training pipeline implementation is in the [src/pipelines](src/tfx_pipelines) directory, which covers the following steps:

1. Receive hyperparameters using `hyperparam_gen` custom python component.
2. Extract data from `BigQuery` using `BigQueryExampleGen` component.
3. Validate the raw data using `StatisticsGen` and `ExampleValidator` component.
4. Process the data using on `Dataflow` `Transform` component.
5. Train a custom model with `Vertex AI` using `Trainer` component.
6. Evaluat and validate the custom model using `ModelEvaluator` component.
7. Save the blessed to model registry location in `Cloud Storage` using `Pusher` component.
8. Upload the model to `Vertex AI` using `vertex_model_pusher` custom python component.


## Model Deployment

The [06-model-deployment](06-model-deployment.ipynb) notebook covers executing the CI/CD steps for the model deployment using [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/overview). The CI/CD rountine is defined in [build/model-deployment.yaml](build/model-deployment.yaml)
file, and consists of the following steps:

2. Test model interface.
3. Create an endpoint in `Vertex AI`.
4. Deploy the model to the `endpoint`.
5. Test the `Vertex AI` endpoint.

## Prediction Serving

We serve the deployed model for prediction. 
The [07-prediction-serving](07-prediction-serving.ipynb) notebook covers:

1. Use the `Vertex AI` endpoint for online prediction.
2. Use the `Vertex AI` uploaded model for batch prediciton.
3. Run the batch prediction using `Vertex Pipelines`.

## Model Monitoring

After a model is deployed in for prediciton serving, continuous monitoring is set up to ensure that the model continue to perform as expected.
The [08-model-monitoring](08-model-monitoring.ipynb) notebook covers configuring [Vertex AI Model Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/model-monitoring/overview?hl=nn) for skew and dirft detection:

1. Set skew and drift threshold.
2. Create a monitoring job for all the models under and endpoint.
3. List the monitoring jobs.
4. List artifacts produced by monitoring job.
5. Pause and delete the monitoring job.


## Metadata Tracking

You can view the parameters and metrics logged by your experiments, as well as the artifacts and metadata stored by 
your `Vertex Pipelines` in [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/metadata).
